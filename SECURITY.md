# Security Policy

At **Rewrite**, we take security seriously and are committed to protecting
our users, partners, and the open-source community that relies on our APIs,
SDKs, and SMS infrastructure.

This document describes how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities
found in any Rewrite open-source project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public GitHub Issue**.

Instead, report it through one of the following channels:

- **Email:** security@rewritetoday.com
- **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred, when available)

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much detail as possible:

- A clear and concise description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact and affected components
- Any known mitigations or suggested fixes

---

## Response Process

Once a vulnerability is reported:

- We will acknowledge receipt within **48 business hours**
- The report will be reviewed and triaged by the maintainers
- Severity will be assessed, including abuse and fraud risk
- A fix will be developed based on severity and impact
- We will coordinate a responsible disclosure after a fix is available

Timelines may vary depending on complexity and severity, but we aim to act as
quickly and transparently as possible.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you **do not publicly disclose** any vulnerability
until we have had the opportunity to investigate and address it.

We strongly support and appreciate responsible disclosure practices and
collaboration with security researchers.

---

## SMS and OTP Security Impact

The following are treated as high or critical impact, depending on exploitability:

- Unauthorized SMS sending or account abuse
- OTP bypass, brute-force, replay, or validation flaws
- Sender identity spoofing within Rewrite-controlled flows
- Webhook signature bypass or message status tampering
- Leakage of recipient data (phone numbers, message content, metadata)

---

## Credentials and Secrets

Accidental exposure of API keys, tokens, webhook secrets, or provider credentials
is considered **critical severity**.

If you believe credentials have been leaked:

- Report the issue immediately using the channels above
- Avoid sharing the exposed data publicly
- Revoke or rotate the affected credentials as soon as possible

---

## Scope

This security policy applies to **all repositories and packages**
maintained under the Rewrite GitHub organization, including all
open-source libraries, SDKs, and tools.

---

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and contributors
who help keep the Rewrite ecosystem secure.

Thank you for helping us improve the safety and reliability of our software.
